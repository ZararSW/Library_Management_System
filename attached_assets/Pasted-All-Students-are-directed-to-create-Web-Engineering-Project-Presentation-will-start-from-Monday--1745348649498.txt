PBL Scenario: Build a Functional Web Application with CRUD Operations

Problem Statement:
You have been hired by a startup to design and develop a fully functional website tailored to a specific industry or domain of your choice (e.g., E-commerce, Library Management, Event Booking, Inventory System, etc.). Your job is to create a responsive and interactive website that allows users to manage and manipulate data efficiently through a user-friendly interface.


---

Your Task:

Design and develop a website that contains at least 3 CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) modules. Each module should represent a distinct entity relevant to your chosen domain.

Examples:
For an E-commerce website, your CRUD modules could be:

Product – Add new products, view all products, edit product details, delete products.

Customer – Register new customers, view customer list, update customer info, delete customers.

Category – Create categories, list all categories, edit category names, remove categories.

Instructions:

1. You are free to use any tech stack of your choice. (Frontend and Backend can be built using technologies like HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, Angular, PHP, Java, Python, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase, etc.)


2. This is an individual project. Each student must create and submit their own unique project.


3. Each of the three modules must implement full CRUD functionality.


4. The interface should be user-friendly, intuitive, and mobile-responsive.


5. Ensure proper validations, alerts, and confirmations for actions like update or delete.


6. Store the data using a backend database or structured file (e.g., JSON) as applicable.


7. Backend and frontend should communicate via proper APIs or server-side integration.
